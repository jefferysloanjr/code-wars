##### Instructions from Code Wars for mutate my string:

        I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne
        into stringTwo one letter at a time.

        Example:

        stringOne = 'bubble gum';
        stringTwo = 'turtle ham';

        Result:
        bubble gum
        tubble gum
        turble gum
        turtle gum
        turtle hum
        turtle ham
