##### Instructions from Code Wars for nice array:

          Given a string and an array of integers representing indices,
          capitalize all letters at the given indices.

          For example:

          capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5]) = "aBCdeF"
          capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5,100]) = "aBCdeF". There is no index 100.
          The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces and an array
          of digits.

          Good luck!

          String array revisal
