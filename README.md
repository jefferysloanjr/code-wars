##### Instructions from Code Wars for nice array:

          Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and
          odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be
          considered even.

          For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test
          cases for more examples.

          The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

          Good luck!
