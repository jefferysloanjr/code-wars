##### Instructions from Code Wars for nice array:

          Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

          Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in
          the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

          You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

          If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest
          in the original string.

          All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
