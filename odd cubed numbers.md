##### Instructions from Code Wars for reversed string.:

        Find the sum of the odd numbers within an array, after cubing the
        initial integers. This function will return undefined (NULL in PHP)
        if any of the values aren't numbers.

        Note: There are ONLY integers in the JAVA and C# versions of this
        Kata.
